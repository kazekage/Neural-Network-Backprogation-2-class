# Neural-Network-Backprogation-2-class
This is the code of Neural Network from scratch using backpropagation and cross entropy as the loss function. I have self generated the data set following the conditions :

1) Two-dimensional patterns with x = (x (1) , x (2) ) are placed at x1 = (1, 0), x2 = (−1, 0), x3 = (0, 1) and x4 = (0, −1). 
2)  x1 , x2 ∈ C 1 and x3 , x4 ∈ C .
3) In addition, we also add 100 − 4 random 2D patterns (giving us a total of 100 patterns with 50 patterns in each class)
    
    obeying the criteria
      If |x (1) | > 1 and |x (2) | < 1, then x ∈ C 1 ,
      If |x (1) | < 1 and |x (2) | > 1, then x ∈ C 2 ,
      Other locations are not permitted.
